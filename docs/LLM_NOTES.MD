- Screenshot storage and management

### Progress Notes

**Date: [Current Date]**

Completed Phase 2 web search and screenshot functionality:

#### Search Integration:
- Implemented a search service for DuckDuckGo integration
- Added support for query generation and filtering
- Created methods for follow-up query generation based on search results

#### Headless Browser Implementation:
- Developed a comprehensive browser service using Puppeteer
- Implemented robust page navigation with retry logic
- Added support for configurable browser settings
- Created methods for handling multiple parallel browser instances
- Set up proper resource cleanup to prevent memory leaks

#### Screenshot Capture:
- Implemented full-page screenshot capture functionality
- Created metadata extraction for captured pages
- Added support for different image formats and quality settings
- Implemented link extraction capabilities for deeper research

#### Job Queue System:
- Created a job queue service with priority-based scheduling
- Implemented job persistence with file system storage
- Added job lifecycle management (create, pause, resume, cancel)
- Developed event-based architecture for job status updates
- Implemented concurrent job processing with configurable limits

#### Data Storage:
- Implemented structured storage for screenshots and metadata
- Created batch-based organization for search and capture results
- Added file system persistence for job data and research results

#### Controller Integration:
- Updated research controller to use the job queue service
- Implemented proper error handling and status updates
- Added endpoints for job management operations

#### Technical Decisions:
1. **Screenshot vs. Direct Scraping:** As specified in the requirements, we implemented a screenshot-based approach rather than direct HTML scraping to avoid potential scraping issues with modern websites.

2. **Puppeteer Configuration:** We configured Puppeteer with reasonable defaults but made settings customizable through options. This will allow tuning for performance in production environments.

3. **Batch Processing:** Implemented batch-based processing for search results and captures to manage resources efficiently and provide better progress tracking.

4. **File Storage Structure:** Organized storage into a hierarchical structure (jobs, batches, captures) to facilitate management and retrieval of research data.

## Phase 3: GUI Implementation

### Implementation Steps
- Create shared UI components
- Implement main application pages
- Set up reactive data stores
- Design research and report interfaces

### Progress Notes

**Date: [Current Date]**

Completed Phase 3 GUI implementation:

#### Shared Components:
- Created StatusBadge component for displaying job status
- Implemented JobProgressCard for showing research job progress
- Developed ResearchForm for submitting new research jobs
- Built ModelSelector for configuring LLM models
- Implemented ReportPreview for displaying research results

#### Main Pages:
- Created ResearchPage for starting new research with:
  - Research job configuration form
  - Active jobs list with real-time progress tracking
  - Detailed job information view

- Implemented ReportsPage with:
  - Report browsing grid with filtering and sorting
  - Preview cards with key information
  - Export functionality

- Developed ReportDetailPage with:
  - Full report viewer with section navigation
  - Source listing and credibility information
  - Export options

- Built HistoryPage with:
  - Tabular job history with filtering and sorting
  - Job management actions (pause, resume, cancel)
  - Detailed job information modal

- Created SettingsPage with:
  - Tabbed interface for different setting categories
  - Configuration for research parameters
  - Model selection and configuration
  - Search engine settings
  - System preferences

#### UI/UX Design:
- Implemented consistent dark theme throughout the application
- Used card-based layout for content organization
- Designed progress indicators for research tasks
- Created responsive layouts for different screen sizes
- Added animations and transitions for better user experience

#### Data Management:
- Implemented mock data services for development
- Set up reactive state management with Pinia
- Created data models matching API requirements
- Added filtering, sorting, and search capabilities

#### Technical Decisions:
1. **Component Architecture:** Used composition API with TypeScript for better type safety and component organization.

2. **Responsive Design:** Ensured the application works well on both desktop and tablet devices with responsive layouts.

3. **State Management:** Used Pinia for global state with separate stores for research, reports, and configuration.

4. **Mock Data:** Implemented comprehensive mock data services to enable frontend development without backend dependency.

#### Next Steps:
- Connect the frontend to the backend API
- Implement multi-language support (i18n)
- Enhance error handling and recovery
- Add user authentication and permissions

## Phase 4: KaibanJS Integration and Report Generation

### Implementation Steps
